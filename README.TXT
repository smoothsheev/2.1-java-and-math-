Question 1. What is the value of each expression after it is evaluated? If the statement is an error,
please write Syntax Error.
a. 1 / 4
0
b. 4.0 / 2
2.0
c. 1.0 / 4.0
0.25
d. int x = 4.0 / 2
2
e. double x = 1 / 4
0.0
Question 2. In the earlier example, we saw that double y = 1 / 3; evaluated to 0.0. Rewrite
that statement so that it evaluates to 0.3333333
double y = 1.0 / 3;

Question 3. What is the value of x after each expression? If it is an error, write Syntax Error.
a. int x = (int) 4.999;
4
b. double x = (int) 0.999;
0.0
c. int x = (double) 8;
8
d. int x = (int) 4.999 / (int) 2.5;
2
e. int x = (int) (4.5 / 0.9);
undefined
